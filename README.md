# CMSE830_midproject
This repo contains the streamlit dashboard of my mid term project for CMSE 830 course
Overview
This project is a dashboard for Credit Risk Analysis, developed using Streamlit. The dashboard provides insights into credit risk through various data visualizations, including credit score distribution, default rate by loan purpose, correlation heatmaps, and interactive plots with filters. The goal is to help users understand relationships between factors like loan amount, income, credit score, and other features affecting credit risk.

Key Features:
Interactive Visualizations: Visualize the distribution of loan amounts, default rates, and correlations between variables.
Smoothing Techniques & Trend Analysis: Analyze trends in credit risk factors using regression and smoothing techniques.
Regression Analysis: Understand the relationships between different factors like income, loan amounts, and credit score.
Forecasting & Data Trends: Predict potential credit risk based on historical data.
